## In class exercise

1. If you wanted to reuse this program for a file that had 17 headers lines. What line of code
would you change in our program?

        Write the line of code that you will replace here:__

        What will be the new code?

        Write the new code here:___

2. would happen if we don’t included `import sys` in our program?

        Write you answer here:___

3. Let’s suppose that the third file that the user provides as input
has only one column. What error message will be generated?

        Write you answer here:___

4. Our program split lines of input files (except the first file) into elements
that are tab delimitated. However, data could be split by `,` or many other
characters. In this case is a good idea to define a new variable that takes the delimiter
provide by the user. Using what you learn about `sys.argv` in this class`.
Write a variable that reads a delimiter (e.g ',') provided as the first input file.

        Write your code here:__
